Solidity Hands-On Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my Solidity Learning Repository! This is where I document my progress in learning smart contract development for Ethereum. Each project reflects a specific topic or concept I've explored, and the repository will be updated as I continue to grow my skills.

ðŸ“š About

This repository contains a variety of personal projects created as part of my journey to learn Solidity. Projects range from basic examples to more complex decentralized applications (DApps).

ðŸ§° Tools and Frameworks

Solidity: The programming language for smart contracts.
Remix: Browser-based IDE for quick development and testing.
Hardhat: A flexible framework for building and testing Ethereum-based projects.
OpenZeppelin: Library for secure and modular smart contracts.

ðŸŒ± Learning Focus

This repository focuses on:

Understanding Solidity syntax and features.
Working with Ethereum standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721.
Deploying and testing contracts on local and test networks.
Building scalable and secure DApps.
